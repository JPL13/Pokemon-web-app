# Pokemon-web-app

This app is a Data Dashboard that visualizes Pokemon Stats using plotly.

This app is available [here]
(https://pokemon-udacity-webapp.herokuapp.com).

## Data Set:

The data set is downloaded from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon).

This data set has 13 columns, including their number, name, first and second type, 
and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

The data as described by Myles O'Neill is:

- '#': ID for each pokemon

- Name: Name of each pokemon

- Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks

- Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2

- Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is

- HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting

- Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)

- Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks

- SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)

- SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks

- Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round

## Plots:

    - First plot compares the mean stats of Legendary vs normal Pokemons
    
    - Second plot shows the Histogram of total scores of Legendary vs Normal pokemon
    
    - Third plot is a Categorical bubble chart with Attack on X-axis, Defense on Y-axis and Speed as size for 
     Top 50 Legendary vs Top 50 Normal pokemon
     
    - Fourth plot is a pairwise PCA scatter plot
    
    - Fifth plot is a 2D PCA Scatter Plot
    
    - Sixth pot is a 3D PCA Scatter Plot
